### Recent changes
1. **Removed terrain generation!** Your welcome!
2. Made a **HUGE** graphics update\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Tile textures are now generated from an atlas (go to src/img/block_atlas.png).\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Unfortunately I had to remove a lot of some old features like terrain\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generation to test the new graphics, but those will be added back as soon as\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possible! (as soon as I *want*, that is) In the meantime, enjoy the 20x20\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;block showcase I added!
3. Completely revamped tile textures\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• I have decided to make blocks 10x10 instead of 16x16 now.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Added new textures and completely remade the old ones,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hope you like them!
