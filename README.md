### Recent changes
1. **Terrain generation is back!**\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made a slight tweak to terrain generation.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the world is still stored in the RAM (which is quite horrible actually) but I plan on changing that in the future.
2. Made **another** huge graphics update\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blocks are once again 16x16 due to 10x10 textures being too limiting and odd-looking\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Added a sophisticated debug screen (now shows more variables and an awesome FPS graph)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed some block textures (**again**)
3. New blocks!\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Added a bunch of new ores! (coal, iron, redstone, gold, emerald, lapis, diamond). These ores will generate naturally deep underground!\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Added a bunch of new building blocks! (glass, cobblestone, bricks, oak planks) These have no use at the moment and do not spawn naturally, but will be implemented in the future!\
4. Plants!\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Added oak trees! These vary in height but look basically the same.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Added grass!
5. Building!\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Added basic block building and breaking.
